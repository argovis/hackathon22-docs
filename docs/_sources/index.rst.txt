Argovis Hackathon Docs
======================

Welcome to the 2022 Argovis Hackathon! In this event, you'll be building analyses around the beta version of Argovis' new API; your feedback and suggestions will shape where we go with this project before launch. On this website, you'll find some documentation about using this API, and related tools.
